    <title>Firstboot Configuration</title>
    <para>The YaST firstboot utility (YaST Initial System Configuration), which
      runs after the installation is completed, lets you configure the Novell
      Linux Desktop system before creation of the install image so that on the
      first boot after configuration, users are guided through a series of
      steps that allow for easier configuration of their desktops. YaST
      firstboot does not run by default and has to be configured to run by the
      user or the system administrator. It is useful for image deployments
      where the system in the image is completely configured. However, some
      final steps such as root password and user logins have to be created to
      personalize the system.

        <title>Customizing Messages</title>
        <para>The utility has standard and translated texts in the default
	  setup. If you want to change those texts, use the firstboot
	  configuration file,<filename>/etc/sysconfig/firstboot</filename>.</para>

        <para>This file lets you change the text of the following dialogs:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Welcome screen</para>

            <para>Finish dialog </para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>To do this, change the values of the respective variables
	  (FIRSTBOOT_WELCOME_DIR, FIRSTBOOT_WELCOME_PATTERNS, FIRSTBOOT_LICENSE_DIR, and
	  FIRSTBOOT_FINISH_FILE). This will give you dialogs with customized
	  text. If the references files are in plain text, they will be shown
	  as such automatically. If they contain any markup language, they will
	  be formatted as rich text.</para>

	  <para>
	  Variable FIRSTBOOT_WELCOME_DIR is path to the directory from which is the welcome message read,
	  FIRSTBOOT_WELCOME_PATTERNS is a list of patterns or filenames which contains the message.

        <title>Customizing Workflow Components</title>

        <para>The default firstboot workflow can be controled using one single

	  complete installation. The firstboot control file consists of
	  workflow and proposal configurations and can be used to add or remove
	  configuration screens depending on the end configuration of the
	  system. The file firstboot.xml is installed with the yast2-firstboot
	  package and can be found at the following location:
	  <filename>/etc/YaST2/firstboot.xml</filename>.</para>

        <para>This file can be modified to match the post installation
	  requirements of the product in question. In addition to the default
	  and pre-installed components, custom screens can be added to enable
	  maximal flexiblity during post installation.
<!-- For more information
	  about the syntax of the control file, see the document titled
	  “Product Installation Control”.

      <title>Scripting</title>
      <para>You can add scripts to be executed at the end of the firstboot
	configuration to customize the system depending on user input or the
	environment of the machine. Scripts should be placed in
